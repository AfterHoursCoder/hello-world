# hello-world
All I want to do is download some colour schemes for vim.

Hi my name is Geoff. One of the hardest things in life is choosing a cool username. Gets me everytime.

I'm a rank beginner at programming; learning R for Study; want to learn python just because; want to learn web development so I can build my own blog site from scratch. Want to learn vim because I'm into this new nerd thing and want to be one of the cool kids. It makes me feel productive while not actually doing any work. I have fantasies of being awake at night in a secret bunker under my house writing completely innocuous code that will benefit noone but myself while my wife and kid are sleeping.

I'm going to seriously regret posting this by tomorrow.

I'm actually really normal early 30's guy with a wife and a boy, who really is a coding beginner. I'm learning R for my university research project which I'm supposed to be working on right now, and procrastination is the only reason I'm still writing. I only signed up to GitHub because I'm trying to figure out how to download the vim colour schemes, because I'm reading an introduction to vim ebook which told me to download them, but didn't tell me how, because I want to learn to use vim so I can procrastinate in style.
